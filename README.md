# JavaScript-ToDoApp

I created this todo app using HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript.

In the javascript part, I selected all elements I want to interact with using document.queryselector.

Then created an array of todo items and displayed in the list.

I then added an addEventListner click event to the button and form to add items to the existing array of tasks.

Also implemented delete functionality and a live counter of tasks.
