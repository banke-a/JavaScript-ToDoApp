# JavaScript-ToDoApp

Todo app using HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript.

In the javascript part, selected all elements to interact with using document.queryselector.

Then created an array of todo items and displayed in the list.

Added an addEventListner click event to the button and form to add items to the existing array of tasks.

Also implemented delete functionality and a live counter of tasks.
